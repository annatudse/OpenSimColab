# OpenColab (OpenSim in Google Colab)
Biomechanical modeling in Google Colab using OpenSim


This project aims to make the life of a researcher easy in dealing with Bio-mechanical models. OpenSim has got 𝐚𝐦𝐚𝐳𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐞𝐬 including C++, Python, and Matlab. Normally, the user installs them on their PC. 

This project adds another interface where one can 𝐫𝐮𝐧 𝐧𝐞𝐮𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐮𝐬𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐨𝐬𝐤𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 & 𝐬𝐢𝐦𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐞𝐛 (particularly on 𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐠𝐥𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐥𝐚𝐛). You can imagine 𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐠𝐥𝐞 𝐃𝐨𝐜𝐬 (𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐞𝐛) 𝐯𝐬. 𝐌𝐢𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐨𝐟𝐭 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐝 (𝐨𝐧 𝐚 𝐏𝐂).

If you are new to modeling, or even an expert in computational and human/animal movement science, you may have to deal with the installation of several packages, set up a new environment on your computer which usually keeps you away from the actual research.


In this project, we use Google Cloud (esp. Google Colab notebooks) and 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐒𝐢𝐦 via Anaconda Cloud easily (<𝟕𝐦𝐢𝐧) so that we can use it without any issue at any computer, collaborate with others and share models fast without even a need to install OpenSim on your computer.

That is it! Enjoy OpenColabing!

We also created several 𝐯𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐨 𝐭𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐬 to learn Google Colab (basic python programming on the web) and OpenColab (𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐒𝐢𝐦 + 𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐠𝐥𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐥𝐚𝐛): 𝐰𝐰𝐰.𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐲𝐮𝐫𝐥.𝐜𝐨𝐦/𝐱𝐮𝐤𝐡𝐦𝐧𝐞𝐳  


How OpenColab works and how do we validate it?

The image below shows how we developed and validated OpenColab. As mentioned, the Conda package was developed to install OpenSim on Colab. For validation, we compared the GUI results (for Scaling, IK, ID, RRA, SO, and CMC) with OpenColab results. The outcomes matched very well.
